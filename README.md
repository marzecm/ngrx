# Situation

1. We have an empty angular app with eagerly loaded module called ```posts```
2. We want to add @ngrx/store and @ngrx/store-devtools
3. Get familiar with Redx DevTools: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en
4. Add minimal setup to start using store
5. Check that state is properly initialized using store-devtools
6. Display data from store in ```PostListComponent```
